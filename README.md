### What this ***does*** have
A comment box for the community, an IFRAME for a whereby meeting
### What this ***doesn't*** have
Everything
I recomend you remix php-poc on glitch and then add contents in index.php there, then create inrg.txt in public. That way rest of server content would be stored in backend so secure.
### Some notes
Most of the notes are provided at the begenning of the source code.
A concept of a login sys is also provided
